## **Alonzo Client Template**
-----------------------------

The Alonzo Client Template is meant to provide a straightforward boilerplate for developing in a Vue, JSX, and FlowType environment. It does not contain any features specific to the Alonzo project, so feel free to use it for any project with highly dynamic UI needs. 


## **Usage**
---------------

There are two steps to getting up and running with this template. First, clone the repository and install dependencies: 
```
> git clone https://github.com/DuncanWalter/alonzo-client-template.git
> npm install
```
Then, configure your workspace to enable proper FlowType and eslint highlighting as you code. This requires an editor extension for eslint. That extension may require a setting pointing it to an eslintrc.json file, which is provided in the template. This repository has that setting built in for vsCode, along with a setting which ignores es5 syntax validation. If you would like to add similar support for your favorite editor, please make a pull request with those additions so we can share what you learned. 

- Install eslint extention for your editor
- If not using vsCode, point eslint extension to eslintrc.json


## **Features**
---------------

Key features of this template are:
- Hot Module Reloading
- Flowtype Integration
- Efficient Production Build
- (Coming Soon) Lazy-Loading Arbitrary Code Securely
- (Coming Soon) Simple Test Harness
